# Python Development Notes

## Why virtual environments?
## Without venv: packages install globally (messy)
## With venv: each project has its own packages (clean)

## Common commands:
deactivate  # Exit the virtual environment
rm -rf venv  # Delete and start over if needed

## Pro tip: Add venv/ to .gitignore
echo "venv/" > .gitignore
